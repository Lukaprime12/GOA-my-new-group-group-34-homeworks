    <h1>AND I HATE IT!!!</h1>

    <!-- so for internal CSS we have create an element called 'style' and inside we are going to write a name of element we want to style and than these {} and inside the code . after thay we are going to create an element and if that element was styled inside of the 'style' element then it's going to be styled . I literally hate internal CSS . -->
